## Setup

Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```console
$ python -m venv c:\path\to\myenv
$ <venv>\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Then install the dependencies:

```console
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```console
(env)$ cd binnet
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
And navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/binnetapp/index`. This should bring you to the Home Page of BinNet.
